    "Imagine that, your boyfriend/girlfriend gave you a birthday surprise every year in last 10years.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one day, your boyfriend/girlfriend asks you:\n",
    "\n",
    "‘Sweetie, do you remember all birthday surprises from me?’\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple question makes your life in danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend your life, you need to recall all 10 surprising events from your memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, recall is the ratio of a number of events you can correctly recall to a number of all correct events.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can recall all 10 events correctly, then, your recall ratio is 1.0 (100%). If you can recall 7 events correctly, your recall ratio is 0.7 (70%).\n",

    "However, you might be wrong in some answers.\n",

    "For example, you answers 15 times, 10 events are correct and 5 events are wrong. This means you can recall all events but it’s not so precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, precision is the ratio of a number of events you can correctly recall to a number all events you recall (mix of correct and wrong recalls). In other words, it is how precise of your recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the previous example (10 real events, 15 answers: 10 correct answers, 5 wrong answers), you get 100% recall but your precision is only 66.67% (10 / 15).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "I want you to use the kNN model I wrote below and plot a precision-recall curve. Whenever I try to do something new, I learn from the documentation. Understanding every line of code, why it is necesary and how to implement it as your own. I want you to use the example in this link: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html and create a precision-recall curve. Here are some tips.\n",

    "1. Ignore LabelBinarize and OneVsRestClassifier (they are used when you have multiple categories in your target variable), they are not necessary for our model.\n",

    "3. Copy and paste the entire code and run it. If there are any errors, read the line where the error happened (highlight the jupyter notebook blue and press L) and what the error is.\n",
    "4. Whenever a variable is assigned, look at where they fit in later.\n",
    "5. If there is a new function called from a package (such as model.decision_function), read the documentation and google search for stackoverflow answers.\n",

You don't want to show someone who has no idea how to code or the process of statistics and you want to show more than just the results to a technical person to see how you got the results. I'll try to explain what is usually put into a technical and non-technical report.\n",

If you did webscraping, SQL queries, data cleaning, EDA and modeling (especially parameters), definitely put at least 1 example of each in (usually you want the most useful EDA that relates to your hypothesis and all the modeling parameters and results explained). You can use definitions without explaining them. You are assuming that the person reading it is also a Data Scientist/Analyst/Engineer/Statistician.\n",

    "Put minimal to zero code into your non-technical report. Talk about everything you did in layman's terms. If you did webscraping, explain where you scraped it, how much data you received and generally the most important features. If you did modeling, explain briefly what the model does and why you decided to pick this model. Explain every term that is considered \"technical,\" such as Linear Regression. Take screenshots of all your plots ALL LABELED and minimize the amount of color you use; Only highlight the most important factors.

    "EDA is different from visualizations. You can plot your target against every single one of your predictors, but do you really need to show all those visualizations on your report? Is your visualizations nicely labeled with minimal colors (no more than 3) and support your claim? Make sure that the visualizations aren't small that nobody can read them or messy with a bunch of numbers. A simple bar graph, highlighting the most important one blue versus the rest being grey is much stronger than each bar graph having the same color."

    "### What are CART Models? (Tuesday)\n",
    "\n",
    "CART stands for Classification And Regression Trees. The easiest way to think of how Decision Trees make \"decisions\":\n",
    "1. Your entire dataset is the trunk\n",
    "2. Each branch is a decision\n",
    "3. End target value is a leaf\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, my favorite way of explaining everything is to use dogs and cats! Let's say we are predicting whether the next animal is a dog or a cat. We have features height and weight. So, Decision Trees makes decisions! Assuming if the animals weight is larger than 15 pounds, it is most likely a dog. The tree splits the dataset with into 2 branches, one with all the animals that weigh lower than 15 and animals weighing more than 15 points. Then in each branch, DT will make another decision either on weight again or height. Let's say we set the Decision Tree parameter to only 2 decisions and let's assume it decides to pick height instead of weight. For each branch, if an animal is taller than 1.5 feet, it is more likely to be a dog. Since we only told the DT to make 2 decisions, this is the last decision and become a leaf node, aka End Target. Therefore, it has split into 4 leaf nodes, separating cats and dogs!"
